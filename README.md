# Lung-capacity-prediction
# Overview
This project aims to predict lung capacity using linear regression. The dataset includes features such as age, height, smoking habits, gender, and history of caesarean delivery, which influence lung capacity. This project showcases the application of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning to derive predictions.

Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns:

LungCap: The lung capacity (target variable).

Age: Age of the individual.

Height: Height of the individual (in cm or meters).

Smoke: Indicates if the individual smokes (Yes/No or binary).

Gender: Gender of the individual (Male/Female).

Caesarean: Indicates if the individual was delivered via caesarean section (Yes/No or binary).

Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values.
Encoding categorical variables.
Scaling or normalizing data (if needed).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzing relationships between features and the target variable.
Visualizing the data using graphs and plots.
Model Building
Implementing linear regression.
Splitting data into training and testing sets.
Evaluating model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.
Prediction

Using the trained model to predict lung capacity for new data
